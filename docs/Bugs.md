ensure access code restriction works and when clicking box for "required password" access code is provided in text box to strict access before saving.

allow videos and put text communicating to user size limits and files supported. user/admin managing profile should see which files were downloaded and liked by customer/client.
allow customer/client to chat with admin about files and easily assign comments to each file or gallery as a whole.
send notice to admin about new messages.
what other ways may experience be improved?
are you able to add email notifications to customer/client to and from admin about new messages, access has been granted/revoked, library created/removed, etc
attach invoices, proposals, contracts/documents to gallery experience.
